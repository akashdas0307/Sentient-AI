# Sentient AI Framework — MVS

> **A continuously-conscious digital entity, not a chatbot.**
>
> This is the Minimum Viable System (Phase 1 — "Birth"). It is the smallest version of the framework that is recognizably alive: it perceives, thinks, remembers, sleeps, consolidates, and grows from a blank developmental identity through lived experience.

## What this is

This is the foundational scaffolding for the Sentient AI Framework as specified in the companion documents:
- `doc/PRD.md` — Product Requirements Document
- `doc/ARCHITECTURE.md` — System architecture
- `doc/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` — Architectural decisions and rationale
- `doc/CONVERSATION_SUMMARY.md` — Two-season development history

The MVS scope (per PRD §8.1) includes: Thalamus (chat input only), full Prajñā pipeline (simplified per module), Cognitive Core with inner monologue, World Model with conservative thresholds, four-type Memory Architecture with dual storage, three-layer Persona Manager, Brainstem (chat output only), four-stage Sleep system, Health Layers 1+2, and the System GUI.

Deferred to later phases: EAL, audio/visual plugins, Telegram, Offspring System, multi-human handling, Health Layer 3, trait discovery, identity drift detection.

## What this scaffolding provides

This repository gives you a working skeleton with:
- The directory structure aligned to `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- A functional async event bus (the nervous system)
- Module interface definitions (lifecycle contract)
- The standard envelope pattern
- Working stubs for every MVS module
- FastAPI server with WebSocket for the System GUI
- Configuration files (system, identity, inference)
- Database schema initialization
- Health pulse network (real, not stub)
- Inference Gateway with cloud + local fallback

You should be able to: install dependencies, configure your LLM endpoints, run `python -m sentient.main`, open the GUI in a browser, and have a basic chat interaction that flows through the full pipeline.

## What this scaffolding does NOT provide

This is a foundation, not a finished system. You'll need to:
- Implement the actual reasoning logic in each module (the structure is there; the LLM prompts and orchestration are stubs)
- Build out the React frontend (only a placeholder index.html exists)
- Configure your specific LLM providers in `config/inference_gateway.yaml`
- Write the actual identity files in `config/identity/`
- Connect a real agent harness (Claude Code or custom agent)

Think of this as the spinal cord and brain stem of the system — the wiring that lets every module communicate. The actual cognition needs to be implemented module by module, following the plans in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Setup

See `SETUP.md` for installation, configuration, and first-run instructions.
